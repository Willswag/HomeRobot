# ROS home assitant
## Explanation
my for my senior design project in college I created a robot to conduct tours based on a predefined map. the project met all the goals set forth but the project was crude and rough around the edges. this is an extension of the tour guide to make a robot capable of being a crude "rosy the maid".

## features
1. define locations in a floor plan that can be parsed to ros such as "refrigerator, oven dining room table charging station"
2.  algorithmic definitions for robot approaches ie directions and approach points to start a more precise approach method
3. Alexa drivers for bringing items, putting up items etc.
4. gui for gui practice and initial setup
5. visual servoing to objects from various camera nodes ie fixed fridge camera, wrist camera or security camera
6.
